Other frameworks built on commons-beanutils, such as Apache Stripes, are likely to expose similar issues. commons-beanutils 1.9.2 has now shipped, including a specialized BeanIntrospector implementation that allows suppressing properties. Frameworks built on commons-beantutils can make use of the new pre-configured SuppressPropertiesBeanIntrospector to address this flaw.\n    ", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "7.5"}}
